Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence
----------------------------------

Given an array of n positive integers. Write a program to find the sum of maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N,N is the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains N input A[].

Output:

Print the sum of maximum sum sequence of the given array.

Constraints:

1 ? T ? 50
1 ? N ? 100
1 ? A[] ? 1000

Example:

Input:
2
7
1 101 2 3 100 4 5
4
10 5 4 3

Output:
106
10

Explanation:
For input:
7
1 101 2 3 100 4 5
All the increasing subsequences : (1,101); (1,2,3,100); (1,2,3,4,5), out of this (1,2,3,100) has maximum sum,i.e., 106. Hence the output is stated as 106.
